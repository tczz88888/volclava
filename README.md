## Description
**volclava 1.0.0** is developed based on OpenLava 2.0 with following its license of GPL 2.0.

OpenLava is a free and open-source workload scheduler that's fully compatible with IBM LSF. It supports diverse high-performance computing and analytical applications.
It came from an early version of LSF through open-sourcing. Its command-line and file formats are similar to most LSF functions, so both users and administrators can easily get the hang of operating it.

**volclava** fixes obvious flaws and adds necessary features, covering the basic functional needs of the EDA business. It's recommended for use in small-scale clusters (with less than 100 nodes) where scheduling performance requirements aren't too high.

Everyone is welcomed to feed back via git issue.


## Support OS
- CentOS 6/CentOS 7/CentOS 8  
- Redhat/Rocky 8
- Ubuntu 20.04

The development and testing operating system for the volclava project 1.0.0 is CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core), which is also one of the commonly used operating system versions in IC design.
CentOS 6, CentOS 7, CentOS 8, as well as their corresponding Red Hat and Rocky versions should all be able to run. The main potential risk lies in that differences in system library versions may affect the operation of some components.

## Install
The following uses the example of setting up a cluster that has three nodes. Please confirm that all hosts in the volclava cluster can access the top-level installation directory of volclava using the same path name. For the convenience of management, it is recommended to move the software to the shared storage path

1. Download the code onto the master node
```
[user1@master-test install_pkg]# git clone https://github.com/bytedance/volclava.git
```
2. Log on master node as root, and enter the source code package directory
```
[root@master-test test]# cd /install_pkg/volclava
```
3. Run install script
```
[root@master-test volclava]# ./volcinstall.centos.sh --type=code --profix=/software/volclava-1.0
....
make[1]: Leaving directory `/install_pkg/volclava'
make: warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete.
Congratulates, the volclava is installed under /software/volclava-1.0
You can source environment by: source /software/volclava-1.0/etc/volclava.sh 
Go on to configure master/compute node and enjoy journey!

```
4. Log on compute nodes and install
```
[root@cmp1-test ~]# source /software/volclava-1.0/etc/volclava.sh
[root@cmp1-test ~]# sh /software/volclava-1.0/etc/volclava.setup
[root@cmp2-test ~]# source /software/volclava-1.0/etc/volclava.sh
[root@cmp2-test ~]# sh /software/volclava-1.0/etc/volclava.setup
```

5. The directory of installed volclava

## Configure
1. Turn off the firewall on the hosts in cluster
```
[root@master-test ~]# systemctl stop firewalld
[root@master-test ~]# systemctl disable firewalld
Perform the same operations on other computing hosts.
```
2. If only the /etc/hosts file is used as the source of DNS resolution, it is necessary to add the mapping relationship between the IP addresses and hostnames of the machines within the cluster to the /etc/hosts file on each host.
```
[root@master-test ~]# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
192.168.1.1 master-test
192.168.1.2 cmp1-test
192.168.1.3 cmp2-test
```
3. Edit the lsf.cluster.volclava file, add the hosts, and then save and exit.
```
[root@master-test-test etc]# vim /software/volclava-1.0/etc/lsf.cluster.volclava
```

## Quick started
1. Startup volclava cluster
```
[root@master-test ~]# yum install psmisc
[root@master-test ~]# service volclava restart
[root@cmp1-test ~]# yum install psmisc
[root@cmp1-test ~]# service volclava restart
[root@cmp2-test ~]# yum install psmisc
[root@cmp2-test ~]# service volclava restart
```
2. Verify the volclava cluster
```
[root@master-test ~]# service volclava status ##check daemons status
lim pid: <5922>
res pid: <5924>
sbatchd pid: <5927>
lim mbatchd: <5940>

[root@master-test ~]# lsid  ##check cluster status

```
3. Submit jobs to verify that the cluster is operating normally
```
[root@master-test ~]# su - volclava
[volclava@master-test ~]$ bsub sleep 100
Job <1> is submitted to default queue <normal>.
[volclava@master-test ~]$ bjobs
